- # Basic user-details form
-   I have successfully created a new HTML page that serves the purpose of storing data in local storage. 
- This page features a form and a table that allow users to update individual rows as needed. Users can add new entries for individuals, including their basic details along with the subjects they are interested in. This functionality enhances the user experience by enabling easy management of data, making it straightforward to keep track of various users and their corresponding details. The integration of local storage ensures that the data persists even after the page is refreshed, providing a seamless experience for users.

- # Handling UI components.
- Handling UI compounds is an essential aspect of web development that focuses on creating user interfaces that are adaptable and responsive to various screen sizes. This involves designing components that can effectively scale and maintain usability across different dimensions, including small, medium, large, and extra-large screens.

- When developing HTML code for user interfaces, it is crucial to consider how these components will behave on different devices. For instance, a small screen, such as that of a smartphone, requires a different layout and interaction model compared to a larger screen, like a desktop monitor. Therefore, developers must implement responsive design techniques, such as fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries, to ensure that UI compounds not only fit well but also provide an optimal user experience regardless of the screen size.

- # Billing cart  [click here](https://rupeshklr1.github.io/MyHtmlOldProject/set2/Final%20project/index.htm). 
- ` This HTML and JavaScript page is designed to handle static user employee details, which are represented in a structured format as follows:  
- [      {empName:"rupesh",empPass:"123456"},      {empName:"user",empPass:"123456"},      {empName:"ind001",empPass:"123456"}, 
    {empName:"ad41926",empPass:"123456"},      {empName:"343676",empPass:"123456"},  ]  
- In addition to this, the product IDs are defined to start from p001 and extend to p030 (inclusive of p030).
- Users have the ability to log in using these static details, which include both user credentials and product information sourced from [DBStore.js ](https://github.com/rupeshklr1/MyHtmlOldProject/blob/main/set2/Final%20project/DBStore.js). This page serves as a foundational component for a billing system tailored for any store, allowing for a defined list of products and users. Users can add products along with the corresponding number of units they wish to purchase. Once they have made their selections, they can generate a bill by clicking on the bill cart button, and they also have the option to reset the form by clicking the reset button.
- The functionality of this system is designed to enhance user experience. When a user successfully logs into the page, they will be redirected to the billing page, which is specifically tailored for their transactions. In contrast, if a user attempts to access the login or billing page without being logged in, they will be directed to the index.htm page, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the billing functionalities. This structure not only maintains security but also streamlines the process for users engaging with the billing system.
