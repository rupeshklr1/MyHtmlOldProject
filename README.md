- # Basic user-details form
-   I have successfully created a new HTML page that serves the purpose of storing data in local storage. 
- This page features a form and a table that allow users to update individual rows as needed. Users can add new entries for individuals, including their basic details along with the subjects they are interested in. This functionality enhances the user experience by enabling easy management of data, making it straightforward to keep track of various users and their corresponding details. The integration of local storage ensures that the data persists even after the page is refreshed, providing a seamless experience for users.

- # Handling UI components.
- Handling UI compounds is an essential aspect of web development that focuses on creating user interfaces that are adaptable and responsive to various screen sizes. This involves designing components that can effectively scale and maintain usability across different dimensions, including small, medium, large, and extra-large screens.

- When developing HTML code for user interfaces, it is crucial to consider how these components will behave on different devices. For instance, a small screen, such as that of a smartphone, requires a different layout and interaction model compared to a larger screen, like a desktop monitor. Therefore, developers must implement responsive design techniques, such as fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries, to ensure that UI compounds not only fit well but also provide an optimal user experience regardless of the screen size.
