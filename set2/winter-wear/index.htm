            <h3>About us...</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;Rains is a contemporary rainwear lifestyle brand creating waterproof designs for the global citizen. Influenced by its Scandinavian heritage, Rains practices an uncompromising approach to simplicity that is as equally rooted in functionality as it is in relevance. Rains is of the opinion that proper rainwear need not come at the cost of considered design. Rather, Rains apparel, bags, and accessories are designed to withstand the stormiest of weather, all while speaking to the current tendencies of today.</p>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;Established in 2012, Rains was founded in Aarhus, Denmark, a city predominantly influenced by its Scandinavian climate and design heritage. The brandâ€™s name is an active word, a statement of its very function. Rains is a company that is continuously innovating, challenging the perception of what rainwear can be. From the headquarters in Aarhus, along with a satellite office in Copenhagen, Rains develops new additions to the expanding collection and exports to 40 markets worldwide.</p>
